            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>Hi, this is Sudhir. Born and raised in Bokaro (Jharkhand). <br>I have done my schooling from Pitts Modern School, Gomia and graduation in Economics from St, Xavier's college, Ranchi.<br><br> After completing my graduation, I started to prepare for competitive exams for Banks, Railways and SSC. My Journey was a bit difficult over there. I cracked many exams in Railways and SSC but didn't come up in merit list. So then I decided to move on and joined TTEC, Ahmedabad and served there for 2 years & 6 months as a chat associate. It was a very enriching experience there. I developed extensive skills working with customers even when they are distressed. As I was good at deescalating situations and finding the way to make the customer happy, I was rewarded by team management on the basis of my monthly performance.<br><br>On April 08 2022, I left this job and decided to advance my carreer in web designing. I personally think that this field suits my personal profile the best, as I do posses all the qualities that are required for meeting the goals. Also as a team player, I believe in driving my data upto an extent where it reflects into my team's achievement.<br> 
            <br> I'll aim non-less than being an important asset to my company. I'll put my efforts, my talent and information to drive the data along with helping those under me to meet the same in an efficient and productive way. If you find my profile to be best fit, please give it a try.</p>
